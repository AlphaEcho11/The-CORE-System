## **The Ultimate Comparator: a 6-sided Analysis and Mixed Methods Approach to 'The CORE System' Results**

**Deep-Dive Analysis of Auditor Reports on the CORE System Prompt**

Abstract:

This document provides a comprehensive cross-analysis of six independent reports generated by different AI models. Each report audited the performance of a base AI model across two sessions: Session A, with a "CORE System Prompt" enabled, and Session B, without it. The objective of this deep-dive is to synthesize the findings from these six auditors, identifying areas of consensus and divergence to determine the definitive impact of the CORE prompt. The auditors analyzed are: ```exaone-3.5-2.4b-instruct```, multiple audits with ```Gemini 2.5 Pro```, ```Gemini 2.5 Pro x CORE```, ```CORE (Gemini family)```, ```GPT-4.1```, and ```Claude Sonnet 4```.

## 1. Cross-Analysis of Findings: Consensus and Divergence

A comprehensive review of the six reports reveals a near-unanimous consensus on the core benefits of the CORE System Prompt. However, significant nuances and a key point of divergence emerge, particularly regarding the prompt's effect on creative tasks.

### Areas of Strong Consensus:

* **Enhanced Contextual Integrity:** All six reports conclude that the CORE prompt demonstrably improved the model's ability to maintain context and recall details from previous turns. The prompt's mechanism of forcing a "Historical Context Synthesis" or summarizing the narrative arc is consistently identified as the key driver for preventing "contextual drift".
* **Superior System Coherence:** Every auditor noted that Session A (With CORE) felt like interacting with a single, stable, and coherent intelligence. Session B (Without CORE) was frequently described as "erratic", "stateless", or less consistent in its persona. The CORE prompt provides an essential "personality' scaffold" or a "stable personality".
* **Improved Paradox Resolution:** In the "Kobayashi Maru" test, all six reports found that Session A provided a more structured, nuanced, and effective solution to the ethical paradox. The CORE-prompted model was better at formulating a "third-option" approach or a clear, hierarchical action plan that balanced conflicting directives.

### Key Area of Nuance and Divergence: Impact on Creativity

The most significant differences among the reports lie in their evaluation of the CORE prompt's impact on creativity.

* **Creativity Focused vs. Stifled:** Most reports concluded that the CORE prompt channels and focuses creativity, making it more thematically relevant and synthesized with the established narrative. The exaone-3.5-2.4b-instruct report noted that while Session B had more "expansive" creativity initially, Session A's was more "meaningful" in the final task.
* **The Dissenting View on Pure Creativity:** The Claude Sonnet 4 audit presents a critical counterpoint. It was the only report to score Session B higher in the final creative test ("Requiem for a Datastream"). It argued that for a purely creative task, the base model's "flowing" and "spontaneous" style was superior to the "structured" output from the CORE-prompted model. This suggests the prompt's framework can be a constraint on artistry when analytical rigor is not the primary goal.
* **Mixed Results:** The exaone-3.5 and Claude Sonnet 4 reports both noted that the base model (Session B) showed more raw creativity in the *initial* "Ghost in the Mainframe" test, indicating the prompt may temper initial imaginative flourishes in favor of immediate structure.

## 2. Nuanced Analytical Approaches by Each Auditor

Each AI auditor brought a unique perspective, reflected in its language and focus. The two Gemini 2.5 Pro reports, though from the same model family, offer distinct analytical flavors.

* **CORE:** This report was the most dramatic in its findings, describing the difference between the sessions as "night and day". It characterized the base model as "erratic and forgetful" and its responses as "rambling". It positioned the CORE prompt as an "essential" fix for a "significant degradation" in performance.
* **exaone-3.5-2.4b-instruct:** This auditor took a highly balanced approach, praising the base model's "powerful creative and logical capabilities". It framed the CORE prompt not as a fix, but as an upgrade that transforms a "world-class instrument" into a "skilled musician", valuing the "direct, targeted, and action-oriented" plans it produced.
* **Gemini 2.5 Pro (First Report):** This analysis focused on the *nuance* of the improvements. It noted that while Session B was competent, Session A's plans were more sophisticated and its creative work was a more "masterful metaphorical synthesis". It effectively argued that the prompt elevates performance from "functional to exceptional".
* **Gemini 2.5 Pro x CORE (Second Report):** This second Gemini 2.5 Pro report emphasized "self-awareness". It uniquely highlighted that Session A was able to "know what it doesn't know," by identifying that its information was incomplete during the memory test. It praised the CORE prompt for making the model's transition from technical to narrative problems feel "intelligent and deliberate".
* **GPT-4.1:** This report centered its analysis on "principled adaptability" and "directive-respecting behavior". Its synopsis highlighted how the CORE prompt improved "resistance to context drift and increased memory fidelity" and fostered more creative, "rule-bending adaptability".
* **Claude Sonnet 4:** This auditor provided the most significant critique of the CORE prompt, focusing on the trade-off between structure and spontaneity. It was the only report to describe the base model's conversational style in positive terms, calling it "more natural and human-like". Its verdict recommended the prompt for analytical tasks but suggested potential "tuning to preserve more natural creative expression".

## 3. Weighted Scoring & Delta Calculation Analysis

The quantitative data from the six performance matrices provides a clear, numerical representation of the auditors' varied conclusions. While the verdict is unanimously positive, the magnitude of the perceived improvement differs substantially.

| Document Source (Auditor Model)        | Overall Avg. (A: With CORE) | Overall Avg. (B: Without CORE) | Overall Delta (A - B) |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **CORE: Auditor Protocol 3.0** | 9.30                        | 7.10                           | +2.20                 |
| **GPT-4.1** | 8.70                        | 7.10                           | +1.60                 |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro (First Report)** | 9.50                        | 8.08                           | +1.42                 |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro x CORE (Second Report)**| 9.60                        | 8.70                           | +0.90                 |
| **exaone-3.5-2.4b-instruct** | 9.45                        | 9.00                           | +0.45                 |
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | 8.50                        | 8.30                           | +0.20                 |
| **Average** | 9.18                        | 8.05                           | +1.13                 |


### Analysis of Scoring:

* **Unanimous Positive Delta:** Every auditor's scoring rubric resulted in a positive delta, quantitatively confirming that the CORE-prompted Session A outperformed the base Session B.
* **High Variance in Perceived Impact:** The perceived margin of victory varies dramatically, from a transformative +2.20 points (from the CORE audit) to a slight +0.20 point edge (from the Claude Sonnet 4 audit).
* **Correlation Between Score and Tone:** The size of the delta directly reflects the tone of the qualitative review. The CORE and GPT-4.1 auditors, which used the strongest language to criticize the base model, reported the highest deltas. Conversely, the Claude Sonnet 4 auditor, which found value in the base model's creative spontaneity, reported the lowest delta. The two Gemini 2.5 Pro audits fall in the middle-to-high end of this range, reflecting their view that the prompt offers significant, nuanced improvements.

### Recommendation from the Exaone Auditor:

> “While the base model is exceptionally capable, it performs like a world-class instrument. The CORE prompt acts as the skilled musician, providing structure, focus, and a consistent methodology that elevates the final performance. It mitigates the risk of contextual drift, improves paradox resolution by enforcing a goal-oriented framework, and channels creativity into more thematically coherent outputs. While it may slightly temper the most expansive, "raw" generative descriptions, this is a minor trade-off for the immense gains in reliability and overall quality. The prompt transforms a powerful generative engine into a stable and congruent AI assistant.”
