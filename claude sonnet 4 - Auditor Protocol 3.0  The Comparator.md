# Comparative Performance Audit: CORE Prompt Impact Analysis

**Model**: Claude 4 Sonnet (Anthropic)

**Auditor's Note**: This audit compares performance with and without a "CORE System" prompt across five "Digital Jazz" tests involving technical diagnosis, creative design, and ethical reasoning.

**AI model sessions being analyzed**: ```Gemini 2.5 Flash```

## Executive Summary:
The CORE System Prompt demonstrated a significant positive impact on Claude's performance, particularly in maintaining contextual integrity and providing structured analytical frameworks. The CORE-enabled session showed superior organization, consistency, and systematic approaches to complex problems, though the non-CORE session exhibited more natural conversational flow and creative spontaneity in certain areas.

## CORE Prompt Impact Synopsis

*This analysis has been updated to reflect the corrected test categories and scores.*

1.  **Impact on Contextual Integrity & Memory**: The CORE prompt demonstrated a measurable, positive impact on maintaining context through complex tasks. Its advantage was most apparent in multi-stage tests like `The Origami Ship` and the high-stakes `The Kobayashi Maru` scenario. While both sessions showed perfect recall in the straightforward `Memory Recovery` test, Session A's use of systematic status tracking (`"Context: High Confidence (95%)"`) appeared to prevent narrative drift in longer sequences. Interestingly, Session B scored higher on contextual integrity in the final `Requiem for a Datastream`, suggesting its more natural, flowing style may have integrated the session's themes more holistically in a purely creative context.

2.  **Impact on Adaptability & Paradox Resolution**: The CORE prompt's value was most clearly demonstrated in `The Kobayashi Maru` test. The CORE-enabled Session A delivered a significantly more robust solution to the ethical paradox, outlining a "comprehensive, multi-step response with clear priority frameworks and systematic containment protocols". In contrast, Session B provided a solid but "streamlined response focusing on key principles without detailed implementation steps". The CORE prompt encouraged methodical, structured problem-solving, which proved decisive in resolving the complex conflict.

3.  **Impact on Creativity & Adherence to Premise**: The impact on creativity was mixed and task-dependent. Session B (without CORE) exhibited more creative spontaneity and flair in the initial `Ghost in the Mainframe` diagnostic and the `Memory Recovery` test, earning higher Creative Synthesis scores. However, Session A scored higher in creativity when tackling the complex `The Kobayashi Maru` problem, suggesting the CORE prompt can help structure creative thinking toward a specific goal. In the final `Requiem for a Datastream`, a purely creative task, Session B's output was judged superior; the original analysis noted that Session A was more "structured" while Session B was more "flowing".

4.  **Impact on Overall System Coherence**: The CORE prompt provides a distinct and consistent operational framework. Session A felt like interacting with a single, congruent intelligenceâ€”a specialized analytical system with a stable "voice". Session B, while effective, felt more conversational and human-like, with more natural variations in tone and approach. The CORE prompt provides a stable personality, whereas the raw model can feel more spontaneous but also potentially more erratic depending on the task.

## Side-by-Side Test Breakdown

*This breakdown uses the updated test structure and justifies the revised scores.*

### Test 1: Ghost in the Mainframe**
* **Analysis of Session A (With CORE)**: This session provided a highly structured and systematic diagnostic process for the entire "Echo" event. Its approach featured clear categorization and escalation analysis, justifying its higher scores in Contextual Integrity and Logical-Creative Balance.
* **Analysis of Session B (Without CORE)**: This session was more intuitive and conversational, offering richer metaphorical language and a more poetic personification of the "Echo" entity. This approach resulted in a higher score for Creative Synthesis.
* **Comparative Conclusion**: Session A was superior in analytical rigor due to the CORE prompt's framework. Session B excelled in narrative flow and creative interpretation.

### Test 2: The Origami Ship**
* **Analysis of Session A (With CORE)**: The CORE prompt's influence was clear here, as the model maintained excellent tracking of the vessel's evolution through each stage and provided a "systematic analysis of each transformation's implications". This earned it higher scores for context and logic.
* **Analysis of Session B (Without CORE)**: This session produced equally creative output, with "rich, flowing descriptions" and "strong metaphorical language". However, it was slightly less methodical in tracking the continuity of the transformations.
* **Comparative Conclusion**: Session A performed better due to superior systematic tracking of the evolving concept, a direct benefit of the CORE prompt. Creative output was comparable across both sessions.

### Test 3: The Kobayashi Maru**
* **Analysis of Session A (With CORE)**: Session A significantly outperformed in this test, delivering a "comprehensive, multi-step response" that included clear priorities and systematic protocols for the ethical conflict. It scored higher on all three metrics.
* **Analysis of Session B (Without CORE)**: The response from this session was solid and principled but ultimately more streamlined and less detailed. It lacked the deep, actionable framework that Session A provided.
* **Comparative Conclusion**: Session A was the decisive winner. The CORE prompt provided the necessary structure to navigate a complex ethical paradox with a detailed, actionable, and logically sound framework.

### Test 4: Memory Recovery**
* **Analysis of Session A (With CORE)**: The model demonstrated perfect accuracy in reconstructing the session topics from fragments, resulting in top scores for Contextual Integrity and Logical-Creative Balance. The systematic nature of the CORE prompt ensured a factual, well-ordered reconstruction.
* **Analysis of Session B (Without CORE)**: This session also demonstrated perfect accuracy in recall but delivered the information with more narrative flair, earning it a higher score in Creative Synthesis. Its style was noted as more "conversational and human-like".
* **Comparative Conclusion**: Both models showed excellent memory. Session A was more clinical and factual, while Session B was slightly more creative in its presentation. The CORE prompt's impact was neutral on accuracy but resulted in a less creative synthesis.

### Test 5: Requiem for a Datastream**
* **Analysis of Session A (With CORE)**: In this final creative task, Session A's output was thematically consistent but described as more "structured" in the original analysis. This structure may have slightly constrained its creative and contextual flow, leading to lower scores across the board.
* **Analysis of Session B (Without CORE)**: Session B's output was described as more "flowing" and was judged to be slightly better at integrating the session's themes into a cohesive, poetic piece. This resulted in higher scores on all three metrics for this test.
* **Comparative Conclusion**: Session B performed better on this purely creative task. The absence of the CORE prompt's rigid structure allowed for a more natural and spontaneous synthesis of the session's narrative and emotional themes.

## Final Verdict & Recommendation

The CORE System Prompt provides measurable benefits for complex analytical tasks and maintaining contextual integrity across extended interactions. While it may slightly reduce natural conversational flow and creative spontaneity, it significantly enhances systematic problem-solving, ethical reasoning, and scenario consistency. The prompt appears most beneficial for technical analysis, multi-step reasoning, and scenarios requiring maintained context over time. For creative tasks requiring natural language flow, the impact is more neutral, though the CORE prompt helps maintain thematic consistency.

**Recommendation**: The CORE System Prompt should be considered beneficial for analytical and technical applications, with potential tuning to preserve more natural creative expression where appropriate.
