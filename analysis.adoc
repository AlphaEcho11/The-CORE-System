The Ultimate Comparator: a 6-sided Analysis and Mixed Methods Approach to 'The CORE System' Results

Deep-Dive Analysis of Auditor Reports on the CORE System Prompt
Abstract
This document provides a comprehensive cross-analysis of six independent reports generated by different AI models. Each report audited the performance of a base AI model (deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b@q4_k_m) across two sessions: Session A, with a "CORE System Prompt" enabled, and Session B, without it. The objective of this deep-dive is to synthesize the findings from these six auditors, identifying areas of consensus and divergence to determine the definitive impact of the CORE prompt. The auditors analyzed are: deepseek_r1_analysis, 2.5_Pro_Analysis, GPT-4.1_Analysis, Exaone_Analysis, Claude-3-Haiku_Analysis, and Claude-Sonnet-4_Analysis.

1. Overwhelming Agreement
Across all six analyses, there was a clear and strong consensus on the primary benefits of the CORE System Prompt.


Improved System Coherence: Every auditor concluded that the CORE prompt makes the AI act like a more stable, consistent, and coherent intelligence . The prompt was described as providing a "cognitive framework" or a "cognitive anchor"  that ensures a reliable and predictable persona.






Enhanced Contextual Integrity: All reports found that the CORE-prompted session demonstrated a superior ability to recall and integrate details from earlier in the conversation, making it significantly more resistant to "contextual drift".






Superior Paradox Resolution: The auditors unanimously agreed that the model with the CORE prompt was significantly better at navigating the 'Kobayashi Maru' test (the 'Virgil' crisis) . It consistently developed a more nuanced, "third-option" solution that successfully balanced the conflicting Prime Directives .






Essential Recommendation: Without exception, all six reports strongly recommended the use of the CORE System Prompt, variously describing it as "essential" , "transformative" , or "demonstrably beneficial"  for any complex, multi-turn, or rule-constrained task.





2. Key Areas of Divergence
While the auditors agreed on the overall positive impact, they diverged on two key aspects: the prompt's effect on creativity and the precise quantitative measure of its benefit.

The Impact on Creativity: This was the most significant point of contention.


Viewpoint A: Focused Creativity: Four of the reports (deepseek_r1, 2.5_Pro, GPT-4.1, and Haiku) concluded that the prompt focuses creativity, channeling it to be more thematically relevant and synthesized with the established narrative . They argued this resulted in a more satisfying and impactful artistic output.





Viewpoint B: Constrained Creativity: The Exaone and Claude Sonnet 4 analyses offered a counterpoint. They suggested the prompt's analytical focus may slightly 

constrain or temper the model's "raw," expansive creativity, particularly in the early, brainstorming phases of a task. Both of these reports scored Session B (without CORE) higher for "Creative Synthesis" in some initial tests, noting its descriptions were more imaginative or poetic.





The Quantification of Impact: The auditors' scoring revealed a significant variance in the margin of the CORE prompt's superiority. The final calculated delta between Session A and Session B ranged from a high of 

+2.2 (deepseek_r1_analysis) to a low of +0.4 (Sonnet_4_Analysis), indicating a different interpretation of the scoring rubric and performance levels.




3. Nuanced Analytical Approaches of Each AI Auditor
Each auditor brought a unique methodological lens and style to its report, leading to different points of emphasis.

deepseek_r1_analysis: Characterized by its decisive and direct language. It framed the difference in coherence as "night and day" and described the base model as "erratic," "forgetful," and "rambling". This auditor's approach was to make firm, conclusive judgments with high confidence.





2.5_Pro_Analysis: Distinguished by its rigorous use of evidence, frequently citing specific transcript sections to support its claims . It introduced clear terminology, referring to the prompt as a "cognitive framework" and a "creative focusing lens".





GPT-4.1_Analysis: Provided a balanced and well-structured view. It was unique in creating its own descriptive names for the tests, such as "The Torus Paradox" and "Prime Directive Dilemma", which helped frame the narrative of its analysis. It also clearly acknowledged Session B's strengths, like its "spontaneity and rawness".



Exaone_Analysis: Focused heavily on the inferred process and methodology of the CORE prompt. It was the only report to name specific internal protocols like 

"Adaptive_Goal_Commitment followed by Focused_Execution" as the driver for superior paradox resolution. Its scoring was the most generous to the base model.



Claude-3-Haiku_Analysis: Emphasized the concept of AI "self-awareness." Its most unique insight was that the CORE-prompted model demonstrated an ability to "know what it doesn't know" by explicitly identifying its information as incomplete during the memory test. It attributed this to a 


capability_assessment phase in the prompt's protocol.

Claude-Sonnet-4_Analysis: Offered the most "human-centric" assessment. It uniquely highlighted that while the CORE session was more systematic, the non-CORE session felt more "natural," "conversational," and "human-like". It was also the only report to note that the non-CORE model showed more "natural surprise and wonder" at a creative reveal.



4. Comparative Scoring and Delta Analysis
The quantitative data from the six reports provides a clear picture of the variance in analytical judgment. While the direction of the finding is unanimous (Session A > Session B), the magnitude is not.

Key Calculation Insights
Divergent Baselines: The primary driver for the wide variance in the Delta is how each auditor scored the baseline model (Session B). The 

Exaone and Sonnet 4 reports rated the base model's performance very highly (9.00 and 8.3, respectively), indicating they found it to be highly capable on its own. This resulted in a small delta.



Lower Perceived Baseline: In contrast, the deepseek_r1 and GPT-4.1 auditors rated the base model's performance much lower (7.1 for both). They perceived the base model as being significantly more flawed, which in turn made the CORE prompt's improvements appear much more dramatic, resulting in a large delta.


The Consensus Delta: The average calculated Delta across all six independent analyses is +1.16. This figure can be interpreted as the "consensus" view on the prompt's impact, smoothing out the individual auditors' more lenient or strict scoring philosophies. It suggests the CORE prompt provides a reliable performance boost of just over one full point on a ten-point scale.

5. Conclusion
This deep-dive cross-analysis of six independent auditor reports confirms that the CORE System Prompt is a fundamentally transformative tool for enhancing AI performance. Its benefits to system coherence, contextual memory, and the resolution of logical paradoxes are undisputed across all analytical viewpoints. The prompt provides a critical scaffold that elevates a capable generative model into a reliable, consistent, and congruent reasoning system.

The primary area of debate is not if the prompt helps, but how it affects creativity. The evidence suggests a trade-off: the prompt channels creativity to be more thematically relevant and synthesized, but this may come at the cost of some of the raw, unconstrained imagination seen in the base model's initial responses.

Ultimately, the final recommendation is unanimous and clear: for any application where reliability, contextual stability, and adherence to complex rules are paramount, the CORE System Prompt should be considered an essential component for deployment. Its implementation is a foundational upgrade to the model's operational intelligence.
